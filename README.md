## How the script works

1. The code will first create a folder called "data" in your working directory if you do not have one
2. setInternet2(use=T) is used in window OS setting in order to read from http**s** urls
3. Out of 561 features, there were 86 relevant features (contain mean or standard deviations measurements)
4. Relevant features,  response/dependent variable/y and subject labels were extracted from both train and test data sets
5. rbind is used to vertically concatenate (merge) the data sets to form the first data set, "full_data""
6. The other data set "full_data_subjectAndActivity" is form by considering group means based on subject as well as activity

### Short description 
> Modified from documentation provided (See links below)

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to **some** of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. They include:

t measurements      | f measurements
:------------------ | :---------------
tBodyAcc-XYZ        | fBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ     | (na)
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ    | fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ       | fBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ   | fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag         | fBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag      | (na)
tBodyAccJerkMag     | fBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag        | fBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag    | fBodyGyroJerkMag

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean  
tBodyAccMean  
tBodyAccJerkMean  
tBodyGyroMean  
tBodyGyroJerkMean
